In any statistical study, the presence of lurking variables and added considerations must be taken into account. Both violent crime and ice cream sales increase during warmer months of the year, which suggests that an association may be linked to a secondary causation. In section 2.3 of the textbook, establishing causality requires us to limit confounding and other factors. For another good example, see the 1960's sutdy on coffee and lung cancer."
